// RELAY has the above data structure for messages. Each message has a reference
// 		to its parent, or null if it is the first message in a chain of messages.
// 		We want to view a chain or thread of messages so we can see full
//		conversations. The messages are stored in an array along with messages
// 		from other conversations, and are not in chronological order.

// 1 Write a function that takes the an array of messages  and the following UID and returns
// 		an array that deeply equals the idealMessageChain array.

// 		UID: 'l42f432lk4l999sdj'
